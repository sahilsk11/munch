## Munch - Crafting a better restaurant choosing process

Munch is a web app that helps individuals discover places to eat around them. Using just the responses from three questions, Munch curates the top five recomended restaurants. Munch gets smarter everytime you use it based on what restaurants you like and dislike. Munch also lets individuals browse trending restaurants and where popular influencers are eating at. 

I used Next.js for it’s speed with developing multi-page React applications with speed. The React code uses Hooks for managing lifestyle and state, which eases clarity in writing code. Since Next.js does not support CSS, all styling is done with inline CSS, making some styling blocks long, but keeping all styling attached to their components allows for faster modifications. The application is hosted on GCP.
